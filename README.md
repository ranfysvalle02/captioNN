## Introduction

Image captioning sits at the crossroads of computer vision and natural language processing, aiming to generate descriptive and coherent sentences that accurately depict the content of an image. This multifaceted task not only requires a deep understanding of visual elements but also the ability to construct meaningful and grammatically correct sentences.

In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into building an image captioning model named **captioNN** using PyTorch. Leveraging a synthetic dataset composed of simple geometric shapes, we create a controlled environment that simplifies understanding each component of the model. This method ensures that **captioNN** is both easy to comprehend and maintain, laying a robust foundation for scaling to more intricate datasets and architectures.

## Creating Synthetic Data

### Why Synthetic Data?

Building an effective image captioning model necessitates a carefully curated dataset. **Creating synthetic data** presents several distinct advantages that make it an invaluable tool in this context:

- **Control:** Synthetic datasets offer complete control over data attributes such as shapes, colors, sizes, and positions. This precision ensures consistency and facilitates systematic experimentation with different variables.
  
- **Simplicity:** Focusing on basic geometric shapes reduces complexity, making it easier to debug and interpret the model's behavior. This simplicity aids in understanding fundamental associations without the noise inherent in real-world data.
  
- **Reproducibility:** Synthetic data guarantees consistent results across different runs and environments. By eliminating variability, we ensure that observations and conclusions are solely attributable to model performance rather than data inconsistencies.

### Generating Shape Images

Our synthetic data generation process involves creating images that feature specified geometric shapes and colors. By concentrating on basic shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, each image possesses distinct and easily identifiable features. This clarity is crucial in facilitating effective learning, allowing the model to form clear associations between visual elements and their textual descriptions.

Imagine a blank canvas where a single, vibrant shape is drawn. The uniformity and clarity of these images ensure that the model's attention remains focused on the relationship between the shape's geometry and its corresponding caption, free from unnecessary distractions.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import random

def generate_shape_image(shape, color, image_size=128):
    img = np.ones((image_size, image_size, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 255  # White background
    color_bgr = {
        'red': (0, 0, 255),
        'green': (0, 255, 0),
        'blue': (255, 0, 0),
        # Add more colors as needed
    }.get(color, (0, 0, 0))  # Default to black if color not found
    
    center = (random.randint(32, 96), random.randint(32, 96))
    size = random.randint(20, 40)
    
    if shape == 'circle':
        cv2.circle(img, center, size, color_bgr, -1)
    elif shape == 'square':
        top_left = (center[0] - size, center[1] - size)
        bottom_right = (center[0] + size, center[1] + size)
        cv2.rectangle(img, top_left, bottom_right, color_bgr, -1)
    elif shape == 'triangle':
        point1 = (center[0], center[1] - size)
        point2 = (center[0] - size, center[1] + size)
        point3 = (center[0] + size, center[1] + size)
        pts = np.array([point1, point2, point3], np.int32)
        cv2.fillPoly(img, [pts], color_bgr)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported shape: {shape}")
    
    return img
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a red circle
image = generate_shape_image('circle', 'red')
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This function creates an image with a single specified shape and color, placed randomly within the canvas. By adjusting the parameters, you can generate a diverse set of images for training and testing the model.

## Managing Vocabulary

### The Importance of Vocabulary

In the realm of natural language processing, **managing vocabulary** is a critical task. It involves creating and maintaining mappings between words and unique numerical indices, enabling the model to process and generate language effectively. Proper vocabulary management is not just a technical necessity; it's essential for ensuring that the model can handle both known and unknown words effectively, thereby improving the accuracy of caption generation.

### Building a Strong Vocabulary

A well-structured vocabulary serves multiple purposes in the caption generation process:

- **Encoding and Decoding:** It helps translate between human-readable text and numerical data that the model can process. Each word is assigned a unique index, allowing the model to convert captions into sequences of numbers during training and back into text during prediction.
  
- **Handling Unknown Words:** In real-world scenarios, models often encounter words they haven't seen during training. By incorporating special tokens like `<UNK>` (unknown), `<PAD>` (padding), `<SOS>` (start of sentence), and `<EOS>` (end of sentence), the model can manage such instances without compromising performance.
  
- **Sequence Alignment:** Special tokens ensure that sequences of varying lengths can be handled uniformly, allowing for efficient batch processing and consistent model behavior.

### Managing Vocabulary Effectively

Effective vocabulary management involves several key strategies:

1. **Frequency Thresholding:** Words that appear infrequently in the dataset can be replaced with the `<UNK>` token. This reduces the vocabulary size, focusing the model's capacity on the most informative words.
   
2. **Inclusion of All Relevant Words:** To handle unseen shapes effectively, it's essential to include all possible shape names in the vocabulary, even if some of them aren't present in the training data. This awareness allows the model to generate captions for new shapes by referencing their corresponding tokens.
   
3. **Consistent Tokenization:** Ensuring that text is tokenized consistently (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing punctuation) is vital for maintaining uniformity in how words are represented and processed.

### The Vocabulary Class: A Key Component

At the heart of our vocabulary management system is the `Vocabulary` class. This class encapsulates all functionalities required to build, manage, and use the vocabulary effectively. By maintaining mappings between words and indices, tracking word frequencies, and providing methods for tokenization and numericalization, the `Vocabulary` class ensures that the model can seamlessly transition between textual captions and their numerical counterparts.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
class Vocabulary:
    def __init__(self, freq_threshold):
        self.freq_threshold = freq_threshold
        self.word2idx = {}
        self.idx2word = {}
        self.word_freq = {}
        self.special_tokens = ['<PAD>', '<SOS>', '<EOS>', '<UNK>']
        for idx, token in enumerate(self.special_tokens):
            self.word2idx[token] = idx
            self.idx2word[idx] = token

    def build_vocabulary(self, sentence_list):
        for sentence in sentence_list:
            for word in sentence.lower().split():
                if word not in self.word_freq:
                    self.word_freq[word] = 1
                else:
                    self.word_freq[word] += 1
        
        for word, freq in self.word_freq.items():
            if freq >= self.freq_threshold and word not in self.word2idx:
                idx = len(self.word2idx)
                self.word2idx[word] = idx
                self.idx2word[idx] = word

    def numericalize(self, text):
        return [
            self.word2idx.get(word, self.word2idx['<UNK>'])
            for word in text.lower().split()
        ]
```

This class initializes with special tokens and builds the vocabulary based on the frequency threshold. It provides a method to convert text captions into numerical sequences, handling unknown words gracefully.

## Handling Unseen Shapes: Improving Model Generalization

### The Challenge of Unseen Data

One of the main challenges in image captioning is enabling the model to **generalize** to inputs it hasn't explicitly seen during training. In our synthetic dataset, while shapes like circles, squares, and triangles are part of the training data, introducing **unseen shapes** like pentagons or hexagons tests the model's ability to adapt and generate accurate captions for new inputs.

### Strategies for Effective Generalization

To help the model handle unseen shapes effectively, several strategies are employed:

1. **Comprehensive Vocabulary Inclusion:** By including the names of all potential shapes (both seen and unseen) in the vocabulary, the model remains aware of these words. This knowledge is crucial for generating accurate captions, even if the model hasn't processed images containing them during training.
   
2. **Distinct Visual Features:** Unseen shapes have unique geometric properties that differentiate them from seen shapes. The model's CNN encoder learns to extract these distinct features, enabling it to associate them with the correct textual descriptions during caption generation.
   
3. **Consistent Caption Structure:** Maintaining a uniform structure in captions (e.g., "A [color] [shape].") helps the model in predicting the correct sequence of words, ensuring that color and shape descriptors are placed appropriately, regardless of whether the shape is seen or unseen.

### The Power of Synthetic Data in Generalization

The controlled environment provided by synthetic data generation plays a key role in fostering effective generalization:

- **Clear Feature Associations:** By limiting the dataset to distinct shapes with uniform attributes, the model can form clear and unambiguous associations between visual features and their textual descriptions.
  
- **Focused Learning:** The absence of unnecessary details ensures that the model's learning is focused on the essential relationships between shapes and captions, enhancing its ability to generalize to new shapes.

### Demonstrating Generalization

Consider the following scenarios:

- **Seen Shape:** The model has been trained on triangles. When presented with an image of a blue triangle, it accurately generates the caption "A blue triangle."

- **Unseen Shape:** Although the model hasn't seen pentagons during training, including "pentagon" in the vocabulary allows it to generate the caption "A red pentagon" when presented with a red pentagon image. This success stems from the model's ability to extract pentagon-specific features and reference the correct vocabulary token.

This demonstration underscores the effectiveness of strategic vocabulary management and the benefits of synthetic data in enabling models to generalize beyond their training data.

## Building a Custom Dataset and DataLoader

### Creating a Custom Dataset

Creating a custom dataset is key to tailoring the data generation process to meet specific project requirements. In our case, the `ShapeCaptionDataset` class serves this purpose, enabling the generation of image-caption pairs that align with our focus on shapes and vocabulary management.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class ShapeCaptionDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, shapes, colors, vocabulary, transform=None, num_samples=1000):
        self.shapes = shapes
        self.colors = colors
        self.vocabulary = vocabulary
        self.transform = transform
        self.num_samples = num_samples
        self.data = self._generate_data()

    def _generate_data(self):
        data = []
        for _ in range(self.num_samples):
            shape = random.choice(self.shapes)
            color = random.choice(self.colors)
            image = generate_shape_image(shape, color)
            caption = f"A {color} {shape}."
            if self.transform:
                image = self.transform(image)
            data.append((image, caption))
        return data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image, caption = self.data[idx]
        numerical_caption = [self.vocabulary.word2idx['<SOS>']] + \
                            self.vocabulary.numericalize(caption) + \
                            [self.vocabulary.word2idx['<EOS>']]
        return torch.tensor(image, dtype=torch.float32), torch.tensor(numerical_caption)
```

This class generates a specified number of image-caption pairs, applying optional transformations to the images and converting captions into numerical sequences using the `Vocabulary` class.

### The Role of DataLoaders

DataLoaders play a crucial role in efficiently feeding data to the model during training and evaluation. They handle batching, shuffling, and parallel processing, ensuring that the model receives data in a format conducive to learning.

In our setup:

- **Batching:** Images and captions are grouped into batches, facilitating efficient computation and gradient updates.
  
- **Shuffling:** Randomizing the order of data presentation prevents the model from learning spurious patterns and enhances its ability to generalize.
  
- **Custom Collate Function:** Given the variable lengths of captions, a custom collate function ensures that all captions within a batch are padded to the same length, maintaining consistency and enabling parallel processing.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence

def collate_fn(batch):
    images, captions = zip(*batch)
    images = torch.stack(images, 0)
    captions = pad_sequence(captions, batch_first=True, padding_value=0)
    return images, captions
```

This function pads all captions in a batch to the length of the longest caption, allowing them to be processed together efficiently.

## Designing the Model: CNN Encoder and LSTM Decoder

### Overview of the Architecture

Our image captioning model, **captioNN**, is designed with a clear separation of concerns, leveraging the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for language generation. This modular design ensures clarity, maintainability, and scalability, allowing each component to specialize in its designated task.

### CNN Encoder: Extracting Visual Features

At the heart of the visual processing pipeline is the **CNN Encoder**. This component is responsible for transforming raw images into high-level feature representations that encapsulate the essential visual information required for caption generation.

**Key Attributes:**

- **Pretrained Models:** Utilizing a pretrained CNN (e.g., ResNet50) accelerates training and enhances feature extraction capabilities through transfer learning.
  
- **Feature Extraction:** The CNN processes the input image through multiple convolutional layers, capturing intricate patterns and structures inherent in the shapes and colors.
  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like adaptive pooling ensure that the extracted features are of a manageable size, balancing computational efficiency with informational richness.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

class CNNEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, encoded_image_size=14):
        super(CNNEncoder, self).__init__()
        self.enc_image_size = encoded_image_size

        resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
        # Remove linear and pool layers (since we're not doing classification)
        modules = list(resnet.children())[:-2]
        self.resnet = nn.Sequential(*modules)
        self.adaptive_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((encoded_image_size, encoded_image_size))
        self.fine_tune()

    def forward(self, images):
        features = self.resnet(images)  # (batch_size, 2048, H/32, W/32)
        features = self.adaptive_pool(features)  # (batch_size, 2048, encoded_image_size, encoded_image_size)
        features = features.permute(0, 2, 3, 1)  # (batch_size, encoded_image_size, encoded_image_size, 2048)
        return features

    def fine_tune(self, fine_tune=True):
        for p in self.resnet.parameters():
            p.requires_grad = False
        # If fine-tuning, only unfreeze layers from layer4 onwards
        for c in list(self.resnet.children())[5:]:
            for p in c.parameters():
                p.requires_grad = fine_tune
```

This encoder leverages a pretrained ResNet50 model to extract rich feature representations from input images, which are then passed to the decoder for caption generation.

### RNN Decoder: Generating Coherent Captions

Complementing the CNN Encoder is the **RNN Decoder**, typically instantiated as an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. This component translates the visual features into coherent and contextually appropriate captions.

**Key Attributes:**

- **Sequential Processing:** RNNs excel at handling sequential data, making them ideal for language generation tasks where the order of words is important.
  
- **Contextual Understanding:** By maintaining hidden states, RNNs capture the context of previously generated words, ensuring that the caption remains coherent and grammatically correct.
  
- **Vocabulary Integration:** The decoder leverages the managed vocabulary to translate numerical representations back into human-readable text, seamlessly integrating visual information with language constructs.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
class RNNDecoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, hidden_size, vocab_size, num_layers=1):
        super(RNNDecoder, self).__init__()
        self.embed = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_size)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embed_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size

    def forward(self, features, captions):
        embeddings = self.embed(captions)
        inputs = torch.cat((features.unsqueeze(1), embeddings), dim=1)
        hiddens, _ = self.lstm(inputs)
        outputs = self.linear(hiddens)
        return outputs

    def sample(self, features, vocabulary, max_length=20):
        sampled_ids = []
        inputs = features.unsqueeze(1)  # (batch_size, 1, embed_size)
        states = None
        for _ in range(max_length):
            hiddens, states = self.lstm(inputs, states)  # hiddens: (batch_size, 1, hidden_size)
            outputs = self.linear(hiddens.squeeze(1))    # outputs: (batch_size, vocab_size)
            _, predicted = outputs.max(1)                # predicted: (batch_size)
            sampled_ids.append(predicted)
            inputs = self.embed(predicted)               # inputs: (batch_size, embed_size)
            inputs = inputs.unsqueeze(1)                # (batch_size, 1, embed_size)
        sampled_ids = torch.stack(sampled_ids, 1)        # (batch_size, max_length)
        sampled_captions = []
        for sampled_id in sampled_ids:
            caption = []
            for word_id in sampled_id:
                word = vocabulary.idx2word.get(word_id.item(), '<UNK>')
                if word == '<EOS>':
                    break
                caption.append(word)
            sampled_captions.append(' '.join(caption))
        return sampled_captions
```

This decoder takes the extracted features and generates captions by predicting one word at a time, utilizing the context provided by previously generated words.

### Bridging the Gap: From Visual to Linguistic

The seamless interaction between the CNN Encoder and RNN Decoder is crucial for the model's ability to generate accurate and meaningful captions. The CNN extracts the necessary visual features, which are then fed into the RNN, guiding the generation of captions that aptly describe the image's content.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
class ImageCaptioningModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, hidden_size, vocab_size, num_layers=1):
        super(ImageCaptioningModel, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = CNNEncoder()
        self.decoder = RNNDecoder(embed_size, hidden_size, vocab_size, num_layers)

    def forward(self, images, captions):
        features = self.encoder(images)
        # Assuming features are pooled to a single vector per image for simplicity
        features = features.mean(dim=1).mean(dim=1)  # (batch_size, 2048)
        outputs = self.decoder(features, captions)
        return outputs

    def generate_caption(self, image, vocabulary, max_length=20):
        features = self.encoder(image)
        features = features.mean(dim=1).mean(dim=1)  # (1, 2048)
        caption = self.decoder.sample(features, vocabulary, max_length)
        return caption
```

This combined model encapsulates both the encoder and decoder, facilitating end-to-end training and inference for caption generation.

## Training with PyTorch

Training the **captioNN** model involves optimizing both the encoder and decoder components to accurately map images to their corresponding captions. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up the training loop.

### Setting Up the Training Loop

**Implementation Example:**

```python
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn as nn

# Hyperparameters
embed_size = 256
hidden_size = 512
num_layers = 1
learning_rate = 1e-3
num_epochs = 20
freq_threshold = 1

# Sample data
shapes = ['circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'pentagon', 'hexagon']
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple']

# Prepare captions for vocabulary
captions = [f"A {color} {shape}." for shape in shapes for color in colors]

# Initialize vocabulary
vocab = Vocabulary(freq_threshold)
vocab.build_vocabulary(captions)

# Create dataset and dataloader
from torchvision import transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToPILImage(),
    transforms.Resize((128, 128)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

dataset = ShapeCaptionDataset(shapes, colors, vocab, transform=transform, num_samples=5000)
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)

# Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer
model = ImageCaptioningModel(embed_size, hidden_size, len(vocab.word2idx), num_layers)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=vocab.word2idx['<PAD>'])
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Move model to device
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    total_loss = 0
    for images, captions in dataloader:
        images = images.to(device)
        captions = captions.to(device)
        
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(images, captions[:, :-1])  # Exclude <EOS> token for input
        loss = criterion(outputs.reshape(-1, len(vocab.word2idx)), captions[:, 1:].reshape(-1))  # Exclude <SOS> token for target
        
        # Backward and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        total_loss += loss.item()
    
    average_loss = total_loss / len(dataloader)
    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {average_loss:.4f}")
```

This training loop processes batches of images and captions, computes the loss, and updates the model's weights accordingly. The `CrossEntropyLoss` function is used to measure the discrepancy between the predicted and actual captions, ignoring padding tokens to focus on meaningful words.

### Tips for Effective Training

- **Batch Size:** Choosing an appropriate batch size balances memory usage and training speed. Larger batches can lead to faster convergence but require more memory.
  
- **Learning Rate:** A carefully selected learning rate ensures stable and efficient training. Starting with a moderate value like `1e-3` and adjusting based on performance is recommended.
  
- **Epochs:** Training for enough epochs allows the model to learn effectively, but monitoring for overfitting is crucial to prevent degradation in performance.
  
- **Validation:** Incorporating a validation set helps monitor the model's generalization capabilities and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.

## Making Predictions and Generating Captions

### The Caption Generation Process

Once the model has been trained, generating captions for new images involves several key steps:

1. **Image Processing:** The input image is passed through the CNN Encoder to extract its visual features.
   
2. **Feature Interpretation:** These features are then fed into the RNN Decoder, which begins the process of generating a caption by predicting the most probable sequence of words.
   
3. **Sequential Generation:** Starting with the `<SOS>` token, the decoder predicts one word at a time, using the context of previously generated words to inform each subsequent prediction.
   
4. **Termination:** The generation process continues until the `<EOS>` token is predicted or a predefined maximum length is reached, ensuring that captions are concise and complete.

### Handling Unseen Shapes During Prediction

A noteworthy aspect of our model is its ability to generate accurate captions for unseen shapes. This capability hinges on two primary factors:

- **Comprehensive Vocabulary Inclusion:** By incorporating all potential shape names (both seen and unseen) into the vocabulary, the model can reference these words even if it hasn't encountered their corresponding images during training.
  
- **Distinct Feature Representation:** Unseen shapes have unique geometric attributes that the CNN Encoder can capture, allowing the RNN Decoder to associate these distinct features with the correct vocabulary tokens.

This combination of vocabulary management and feature extraction allows the model to generalize effectively, ensuring accurate caption generation for both familiar and new shapes.

### Demonstrating Accurate Caption Generation

Consider the following scenarios:

- **Seen Shape:** The model has been trained on triangles. When presented with an image of a blue triangle, it accurately generates the caption "A blue triangle."

- **Unseen Shape:** Although the model hasn't seen pentagons during training, by including "pentagon" in the vocabulary and recognizing its unique features, it can generate the caption "A red pentagon" when presented with a red pentagon image.

This demonstration underscores the model's robustness and its ability to generalize beyond its training data, a testament to effective vocabulary management and feature extraction.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
# Function to generate caption for a single image
def generate_caption(model, image, vocabulary, transform, device, max_length=20):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        image = transform(image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)  # Add batch dimension
        caption = model.generate_caption(image, vocabulary, max_length)
    return caption[0]

# Example usage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate an unseen shape image (e.g., pentagon)
unseen_image = generate_shape_image('pentagon', 'purple')
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(unseen_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

# Generate caption
caption = generate_caption(model, unseen_image, vocab, transform, device)
print(f"Generated Caption: {caption}")
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to generate a caption for a newly created image of an unseen shape, showcasing the model's ability to handle novel inputs effectively.

## How the Model Generates Captions for Unseen Shapes

### Understanding Generalization

A fundamental question arises: **How can the model generate accurate captions for shapes it hasn't explicitly seen during training?** The answer lies in the interplay between vocabulary management, feature extraction, and the structured simplicity of the synthetic dataset.

### Vocabulary as the Gatekeeper

Our vocabulary isn't just a list of words; it's a carefully crafted mapping that bridges visual features with linguistic expressions. By ensuring that all potential shape names, including those not present in the training data, are part of the vocabulary, the model remains aware of these words' existence. This awareness is crucial for generating accurate captions for unseen shapes.

### Distinct Feature Extraction

The CNN Encoder's ability to extract unique visual features for each shape plays a key role. Even if a shape like a pentagon wasn't part of the training dataset, its geometric properties (e.g., five sides) are distinct enough for the encoder to capture its essence. These captured features are then relayed to the RNN Decoder, which references the correct vocabulary token to formulate the caption.

### Consistent Caption Structure

The uniformity in caption structure (e.g., "A [color] [shape].") simplifies the model's task, allowing it to predict the correct sequence of words based on the extracted features. This consistency ensures that, regardless of whether a shape is seen or unseen, the model can accurately place color and shape descriptors in their respective positions within the caption.

### The Synergy of Components

The seamless collaboration between the CNN Encoder, RNN Decoder, and the managed vocabulary culminates in a model that not only excels at generating captions for familiar shapes but also demonstrates remarkable adaptability when faced with new inputs. This synergy is a testament to the thoughtful design and strategic management of vocabulary and feature extraction.
